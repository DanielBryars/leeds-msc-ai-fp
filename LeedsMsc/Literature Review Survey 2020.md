I want a Model Free approach (ie no predetermined model of the object to pick up)

- Segmenting shapes from the scene without templates.
    
- Learning affordances (e.g. grasp points) from data rather than fitting to a known shape.
    
- Using deep learning to predict grasps or actions from raw images/point clouds.

"Model-free approaches are attractive due to their generalization capabilities to novel objects, but are mostly limited to top-down grasps and do not allow a precise object placement which can limit their applicability." [A Survey on Learning-Based Robotic Grasping](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43154-020-00021-6.pdf)

**Is good because we don't need to place accurately.**
