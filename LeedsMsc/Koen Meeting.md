Simple task 80 teleoperation for boxes.
Data but okay.

Mug here, okay more robust to envrionmments, add clutter, lighting changes, etc, nice.

Can it generalise to clutter.

80 to 99 percent, okay.

Sensitivite SmolVLA, Pi0.5

tip - evaluate the model. Validation set, literally have to put in real life, let it try to pick up 10 blocks.

Then it's okay.
