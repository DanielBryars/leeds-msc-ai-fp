Background

NeoIntralogistics is a warehouse automation company. In our system items are stored in bins  which are stored on shelves in isles. When an order is placed in the system, a specialised carrier robot collects the bin and transfers it to a station. In this station a Universal Robot arm takes the bin an places this bin on a shelf near a human operator. Humans transfer specific items from bins either into a package for direct sending, or into another bin for consolidation with other items.  This process is called picking. There is an opposite process called stowing where items are placed into bins and the robots put them on shelves.

Bins (how big are they, how much do they weigh?) contain different type of item, so in a bin might be an IPhone, a teddy bear, a pair of scissors and a T-Shirt. Distribution is random. Usually there are 5 items in bin. Items can overlap each other in the bin.

There are several operational inefficiencies which are good candidates for improvement. 

Stock Taking
Currently manual, we need to check if the database records match what is in the bins. It should be easy to check if a bin is empty, and get progressively more difficult as more items are in a bin to recognise what's in the bin.

Automated Consolidation
Currently manual, it would be great if we could pick items from the bin and consolidate them into another bin using the UR robots.

Define Problem
We do not have a "model" of the items in stock (eg a CAD model, or point cloud), in most scenarios we don't know what an item even looks like.
